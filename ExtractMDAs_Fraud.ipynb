       "'Item 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with \"Selected Consolidated Financial Data\" and our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. Strategic Overview From 1994 through the middle of 1996, we were solely in the business of developing and licensing core speech technologies. Commencing in the second half of 1996, we started to expand our business into applications, solutions and services. These applications, solutions and services have grown to include dictation, machine and human translation, including Internet/intranet translation, education, telephony, enterprise and embedded solutions, as well as consulting and localization services. While expanding into these applications and services, we have continued to strengthen our technology leadership in core speech and language technologies. As a result, we believe that we offer the broadest portfolio of speech and language technologies, including automatic speech recognition, text to speech, speech and music compression, machine translation and linguistic components. We further believe that our introduction of breakthrough technologies, such as RealSpeak(TM) for text to speech, will further strengthen our position in technology licensing and telephony solutions. In 1997, we began licensing our software development kits and tools to selected developers in various areas. Since that time, we have refined and enhanced our development kits and tools. It is now our policy to expand our licensing of these development kits and tools to strategic partners and applications developers for the development and commercialization of speech and language applications in a wide range of markets and languages. We have further enhanced our competitive position by developing speech and language technologies and applications for a number of languages. We have traditionally developed these technologies and applications for twelve key languages: American English; UK English; German; French; Italian; Spanish; Portuguese; Dutch; Korean; Arabic; Chinese and Japanese. We believe that there may develop a significant demand for additional language versions of our technologies and applications in response to many factors, including the increasing use of speech as a user interface for computers, the growth of the Internet and the potential demand of real time translation, and the globalization of telecommunication. To address these large potential markets, beginning in the second half of 1998, we have implemented a strategy to expand the breadth of our speech and language technologies to include a total of up to 36 languages. We have licensed our software development kits and tools to strategic partners to develop additional language versions of our technologies and applications. These strategic partners take the financial risk and share in the rewards for speech and language applications for these additional languages. During 1999 we entered into strategic alliances for the development of Thai, Thamil, Hindi, Turkish, Vietnamese, Urdu, Malay, Taiwanese, Arabic and Armenian languages. Beginning in the third quarter of 1999, we further expanded our strategic alliance program by licensing our software development kits and tools to strategic partners to develop machine translation language pairs. Recently, the Far East has become a major focus of our business strategy, and, during 1999, our revenues from the Far East increased substantially. We began developing speech engines for Asian languages in 1995 and introduced Korean and Japanese versions of our text to speech and automatic speech recognition technologies in 1996 and 1997. Since 1997, we have continued to develop and enhance Asian language versions of our technologies and applications. During 1998 and 1999, we expanded our Asian language offerings to include specific solutions for telephony, embedded, automotive, translation and intelligent content management applications. We opened our research and development business center (competence center) in Singapore in 1998. Through this competence center, during 1999, we licensed our development tools to various Asian strategic partners for the development of versions of our technologies and applications in additional Asian languages. We also have expanded our business reach to Asian manufacturers of consumer, automotive, embedded and telephony applications during 1998 and 1999. 43 In September 1999, we acquired Bumil Information & Communication, Co., Ltd., a developer of interactive voice, call center and other telephony and telecommunications market applications, based in Seoul, South Korea. This acquisition provides us with increased resources to apply our core technologies to develop telephony applications and solutions. Following this acquisition, we accelerated the introduction of our speech and language technologies, products, solutions and services for enterprise and telephony into the Korean market. In the fourth quarter of 1999, by combining our technologies, products, solutions and services with Bumils existing business, we were able to substantially increase our revenues in Korea. In addition to licensing our core speech technology, our offerings in Korea include the following products and services: . Client services for call centers and automated attendants (currently in use by banks, securities companies and other corporate customers); . Client service solutions for on line securities trading (currently in use in over 15 securities companies in Korea); . Applications for games, toys, and consumer appliances; . Voice portals and speech services for stock quotes, news and sports; . Integration of speech and language technology for document management; and . Application of speech and language solutions for English as a second language. We intend to begin to introduce our enterprise and telephony applications, solutions and services, including some of those listed above, to other markets, including Japan and other countries in Asia, Europe and the Americas. During 1999, we also began to shift our strategy in Europe and America from pure licensing of our speech and language technologies to the licensing of our technologies in the context of joint development projects with our customers for the development of speech and language applications. The goal of this shift in strategy is to increase our revenues by structuring our licensing to achieve greater revenue sharing with our customers. This shift has resulted in a reduction of our receipt of up front license fees for these products in both Europe and America. We also intend to focus on developing telephony applications and embedded solutions for the wireless consumer and automotive electronics markets. In addition, we intend to develop and apply our technologies to deliver corporate solutions for Internet and e commerce companies, as well as intranet and client/server environments. In April 2000, together with Visteon Corporation, we announced our intention to create a joint venture dedicated to advancing and accelerating the speech interface in automotive applications. In connection with our expansion of our business into speech and language applications, we have successfully entered the dictation, machine translation and education markets. Our award winning Voice Xpress products have facilitated our entry into the retail computer application market. We have also expanded our reach into the medical dictation market. We intend to leverage our position in this market where we believe the estimated $6 billion transcription market, as well as the medical record market, represent a large potential area of growth for us. During the past year, we have been developing and acquiring resources with a goal of creating a technology enhanced enterprise dictation and transcription solution for the healthcare industry. During the third quarter of 1999, we acquired the Articulate Systems division of Fonix Corporation. This acquisition provided us with additional resources to create enterprise dictation and transcription solutions for the healthcare market. In furtherance of this strategy, in November 1999, we acquired the southern Florida based medical transcription business of Rodeer Systems, Inc. and in January 2000, pursuant to agreements entered into in December 1999, we acquired OmniMed Transcription, Inc. and Linguistic Technologies, Inc. OmniMed is a medical transcription company based in Madison, Wisconsin. Linguistic Technologies, located in Edina, Minnesota, is a speech recognition technology company focused on the medical transcription market. Linguistic Technologies has developed advanced software designed to help make the traditional medical transcription process more efficient. The southern Florida medical transcription offices of Rodeer add a southeast component to our planned enterprise dictation and transcription solution. In addition to these acquisitions, in May 2000, we acquired Dictaphone, a leader in the medical dictation and patient record market. We believe that our acquisition of Dictaphone will provide us with a wide range of assets to further our healthcare business strategies. Dictaphones healthcare market assets include approximately 5,000 medical industry customers, approximately 100 sales representatives, a national network of technical service representatives and a broad range of solutions for medical industry dictation and data management. We have also recently entered into an agreement to acquire several additional territories of Rodeers medical transcription business. 44 We have traditionally provided our translation and localization services to large corporations in the information technology, telephony, automotive and aerospace markets. These projects are often multi million dollar, long term projects. We have recently introduced our Internet Translation service, which we believe will enable us to further expand our existing translation services business. Acquisition Overview Following our formation in 1987, we initially focused on the development of our core speech technologies. Beginning in the third quarter of 1996, we began expanding our business, moving into applications, solutions and services, through internal development and acquisitions. We have set forth below a summary of our more significant acquisitions and acquisitions under agreement, since January 1, 1999. Dictaphone Corporation On May 5, 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Dictaphone Corporation through a merger of Dictaphone into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Dictaphone Corporation, headquartered in Stratford Connecticut, is a leader in selected vertical markets in the development, manufacture, marketing, service and support of integrated voice and data management systems and software, including dictation, voice processing, voice response, unified messaging, records management, call center monitoring systems and communications recording. Dictaphone has two operating segments, System Products and Services and Contract Manufacturing. The System Products and Services segment consists of the sale and service of system related products to dictation and voice management and communications recording system customers in selected vertical markets. The Contract Manufacturing segment consists of the manufacturing operations which provides outside electronics manufacturing services to original equipment manufacturers in the telecommunication, data management, computer and electronics industries. During 1999, Dictaphone had total revenues of $353.7 million and a net loss of $8.9 million. In connection with the merger we issued a total of approximately 9.4 million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Dictaphone common stock. We were also required to assume or refinance approximately $430 million of Dictaphone debt and other obligations as more fully described under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources below. We will use the purchase method to account for this acquisition. Dragon Systems, Inc. On June 7, 2000, we acquired Dragon Systems, Inc. through its merger with and into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Dragon Systems, headquartered in Newton, Massachusetts, is a leading supplier of speech and language technology. Dragon Systems product offerings include continuous and discrete dictation products for consumer, business and professional markets, command and control programs, vertical market add on vocabularies for specialized applications, such as legal and medical, customized telephony solutions, and developers tools. During 1999, Dragon had total revenues of $60.0 million and a net loss of $21.8 million. In connection with the merger we issued approximately 10.01 million shares of our common stock to Dragon stockholders in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Dragon common stock. In addition, we converted all outstanding Dragon stock options into options to acquire approximately 1.65 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $20.15 per share. We will use the purchase method to account for this acquisition. Other Significant Acquisitions . In June 1999, we acquired Brussels Translation Group N.V. for approximately $42 million in cash and the assumption of approximately $17 million of debt. We had developed translation technology for Brussels Translation Group for specified languages for use over the Internet and intranet environments. . In September 1999, we acquired substantially all of the assets of the Articulate Systems Division of Fonix Corporation for an aggregate of approximately $24.0 million in cash, with an additional $4.0 million earn out 45 over two years based on performance. The assets acquired represent Fonixs continuous dictation and reporting business, including its PowerScribe(R) technology, for the medical market. . In September 1999, we acquired Bumil Information & Communication, Co., Ltd., a developer of interactive voice, call center and other telecommunications market applications, based in Seoul, South Korea. We purchased Bumil for approximately $25.0 million plus an additional $25.0 million that was paid in the first quarter of the current year based upon performance. . In November 1999, we acquired the southern Florida based medical transcription business of Rodeer Systems, Inc. for approximately $6.4 million in cash. . In January 2000 we acquired OmniMed Transcription, Inc. and Linguistic Technologies, Inc. OmniMed is a medical transcription company based in Madison, Wisconsin. Linguistic Technologies, located in Edina, Minnesota, is a speech recognition technology company focused on the medical transcription market. The purchase price for the three acquisitions totaled approximately $38.6 million. Up to an additional $4.8 million is payable should the acquired businesses meet agreed upon performance criteria. . In February 2000, we acquired Elan Informatique S.A., a France based text to speech technology provider, for approximately $5.1 million in cash. In addition, we will be obligated to pay up to an additional $8 million to the former stockholders of Elan if certain financial milestones are met by Elan during the years 2000 and 2001. . In April 2000, we acquired Interactive Systems Inc., a Pittsburgh based speech and language technology developer, for approximately $8.9 million in cash with a $4 million earn out over 2 years. The assets from this acquisition will provide us with additional expertise with which to further natural language understanding, a technology that figures prominently in data mining, data management, audio mining, clinical language understanding and other processes needed for comprehensive healthcare and telecommunications solutions. . In May 2000, we entered into an agreement to acquire additional assets of Rodeer Systems, Inc., consisting of Rodeers business operations in the states of Arizona, Georgia, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Texas and some operations in California for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25 million in cash. We intend to continue to supplement our development activities through the acquisition or licensing of complementary businesses and technologies. Financial Overview In January 1999, we reorganized our business into three customer focused divisions: Speech and Language Technologies and Solutions; Speech and Language Applications; and Speech and Language Consulting and Services. Prior to January 1999, we operated our business in four divisions: core speech technologies; dictation technologies; translation services; and language technologies. Our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998 have been restated to reflect the three division format. Our speech and language technologies and solutions division focuses on licensing our core speech and language technologies and development tools for those technologies, and developing and selling enterprise and telephony solutions incorporating those technologies. We derive our speech and language technologies and solutions revenue primarily from the licensing of these technologies and tools to applications developers, strategic partners, original equipment manufacturers, component manufacturers and software vendors, that incorporate our technologies in their products or products under development, as well as by sales of custom solutions for business enterprises and telecommunications. Payments under our license agreements include nonrefundable, up front license fees, including up front minimum royalties, ongoing license fees, engineering fees, sales of solution services, or any combination of these payments. Nonrefundable up front license fees are often based upon a percentage of projected sales volume over the term of the license agreement and have represented a majority of our core technologies and solutions revenue. We also received nonrefundable up front license fees in connection with the license of our development tools to strategic partners to develop additional language versions and language pairs for our core speech technology products. Ongoing license fees are based upon sales of products incorporating our technologies. Due to licenses to customers that ultimately sell products incorporating our technologies to end users through retail channels, we 46 anticipate that future revenues from our speech and language technologies and solutions division may become seasonal, with higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters. Our speech and language applications division offers a wide range of end user applications, as well as software development tools and kits for customers to develop their own applications. Our end user applications include dictation software that enables users to dictate text and generate documents by speaking naturally without pausing between words, PC and Internet based translation software and educational software. Markets addressed by these applications include healthcare, legal, public safety and general personal computer markets. We generally license these products through retail channels, directly to hospitals and large institutions, and through value added resellers. Our speech and language applications revenue also includes nonrefundable up front license fees received from strategic partners in connection with the license of our development tools to develop additional language versions and language pairs for our applications products. We anticipate that revenue from sales of speech and language applications to the general personal computer market may become seasonal, with higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters. These revenues may also fluctuate significantly depending upon the timing and acceptance of new product releases. Our speech and language consulting and services division provides a wide range of linguistic services, such as our document translation and software localization services, including our recently introduced Internet/intranet based machine translation services. We provide our linguistic services in various languages to a wide range of customers, with an emphasis on the computer, consumer product, automotive, and telecommunications industries. As a result, these revenues may be somewhat seasonal, with lower revenues in the first and second quarters. We recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses upon satisfaction of all of the following criteria: signing of the license agreement; shipment of our products; no significant contractual terms remaining unsatisfied; and if applicable, receipt of a royalty report from the customer. We recognize revenues from nonrefundable minimum license agreements upon signing of the agreements and delivery of the technology if the nonrefundable payments are payable within 90 days, although we generally require payment obligations to be within a significantly shorter period of time. We recognize revenues from engineering fees, maintenance and support services, and translation services as the services are performed. We recognize revenues related to software development contracts based on the percentage of completion method. In all cases, we recognize revenue only when collection of the related receivable is probable. The Belgian government, the European Union, the government of Singapore, and the United States have provided funding to us for research and development projects. We do not include these amounts in revenues but rather offset the amount of funding against gross research and development expense. Our lines of business have different gross profit margins and have experienced different growth rates in total revenues. In 1999, revenues from our technologies and solutions and our applications divisions grew at a faster rate than revenues from our consulting and services division. The revenues for the technologies and solutions and our applications divisions consisted mainly of software licenses and software products, which contributed to higher gross profit margins than those achieved in the consulting and services division. The growth of revenues relating to consulting and services in relation to our other businesses or other changes in the relative level of sales among our lines of business could result in a material reduction in our overall gross profit margins. At the end of 1999, we entered into the human medical transcription services business. This business is a lower gross margin business, similar to human translation. Our further expansion into the human transcription business could also result in a material reduction in our profit margins. We charge all costs of establishing technological feasibility of software products to research and development expense as incurred. Once technological feasibility of a product is established, software development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalization of software development costs ceases and amortization commences when the product is available for general release to customers. We amortize software development costs over the shorter of the useful life of the software or three years. Our business is conducted worldwide, primarily in Western Europe, the United States and Asia. Our revenues, other than translation services revenue, are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Translation services revenue is primarily denominated in local currencies. We incur expenses primarily in Belgian francs, U.S. dollars, the euro, as well as in a number of other currencies. 47 Our business will be subject to risks of currency fluctuations as well as other risks generally associated with international sales. In 1999 we derived approximately $151.5 million of revenues from the Far East, approximately $79.3 million from the United States and approximately $113.4 million from Europe and other. Since 1996, we have not entered into any exchange rate hedging transactions, although we may enter into hedge contracts in the future. Our decision not to enter into hedging transactions has been primarily attributable to our perception of the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Belgian franc and our receipt of significant sums of Belgian francs from capital transactions, principally the exercise of warrants which partially offset our expenses denominated in Belgian francs. The average exchange rates used for converting Belgian francs to U.S. dollars for our results of operations were 35.72, 36.28 and 37.81 Belgian francs per U.S. dollar for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. We cannot guarantee that the U.S. dollar will continue to be stronger than the Belgian franc or that we will continue to raise capital in Belgian francs. Exchange rate fluctuations whether or not we enter into hedge transactions may materially harm our business. Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues: Year ended December 31, 1997 1998 1999 Revenues: Technologies and Solutions.............................. 34% 39% 40% Applications............................................ 34 29 33 Consulting and Services................................. 32 32 27 Total Revenues...................................... 100 100 100 Cost of sales: Technologies and Solutions............................... 7 6 6 Applications............................................. 13 9 5 Consulting and Services.................................. 19 18 16 Total cost of sales................................. 39 33 27 Selling, general and administrative........................... 26 28 30 Research and development, net................................. 6 12 15 Amortization of goodwill...................................... 7 9 9 Write off of in process research and development.............. 34 38 Other operating expense....................................... 2 1 Total operating expense............................. 114 121 81 Operating income (loss)....................................... (14) (21) 19 1999 Compared with 1998 Revenues. Total revenues increased by 63% to approximately $344.2 million in 1999 from approximately $211.6 million in 1998. This increase was attributable to increases in revenues of all of our divisions, primarily from the Far East where our revenues increased substantially due to up front license fees received from various Asian strategic partners for the license of our development tools for the development of versions of our technologies and applications in additional Asian languages, as well as due to revenues generated in the Korean market as a result of combining our technologies, products, solutions and services with Bumils existing business. In 1999 our revenue from the Far East increased to $151.5 million from $9.7 million in 1998. Technologies and solutions revenue increased by 67% to approximately $138.7 million in 1999 from approximately $82.8 million in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in revenue associated with the telecommunications market, the personal computer, multimedia and embedded markets, as well as increased revenues associated with the license of our development tools. In 1999, our technologies and solutions revenue also included approximately $33.7 million in nonrefundable up front license fees from strategic partners in connection with the license of our development tools to develop additional language versions and language pairs for our core speech and language technologies. This compares to approximately $10.5 million of such revenue in 1998. These increases were partially offset by the elimination of engineering revenue associated with the Brussels Translation 48 Group project. In 1998, we had approximately $9.0 million of engineering revenue from the Brussels Translation Group included in speech and language technologies and solutions revenue, compared to approximately $1.0 million of such revenue in the first quarter of 1999. Speech and language applications revenue increased by 87% to approximately $113.7 million in 1999 from approximately $60.9 million in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in revenues associated with the industry solutions and the retail and professional markets, as well as increased revenues associated with the license of our development tools. In 1999 our applications revenue included approximately $33.7 million in nonrefundable up front license fees from strategic partners in connection with the license of our development tools to develop additional language versions and language pairs for our applications products. This compares to approximately $10.5 million of such revenue in 1998. These increases were partially offset by the elimination of engineering revenue associated with the Brussels Translation Group project that was completed in the first quarter of this year. In 1998, we had approximately $9.0 million of engineering revenue from the Brussels Translation Group included in speech and language applications revenue, compared to approximately $1.0 million of such revenue in the first quarter of 1999. Speech and language consulting and services revenue increased by 35% to approximately $91.9 million in 1999 from approximately $67.9 million in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of additional translation services businesses as well as internal growth. During 1999, we began to focus on penetrating the Internet translation market. In the fourth quarter of 1999, approximately 18% of our speech and language consulting services revenue was attributable to Internet related business. Revenues from Microsoft and its affiliates constituted 28% of consulting and services revenue in 1999 and 27% in 1998. Cost of Sales. Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 27% in 1999 from 33% in 1998. This decrease was primarily attributable to an improvement in margins of both our technologies and solutions, and applications divisions, and an increase in the percentage of our revenues derived from those divisions. Costs of speech and language technologies and solutions revenue as a percentage of such revenue decreased to 14% in 1999 from 15% in 1998. Our improvement in margins was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of sales of products and technologies, including increased tool licensing revenue, which have a relatively lower cost of sales. Costs of speech and language applications revenue as a percentage of such revenue decreased to 17% in 1999 from 29% in 1998. This improvement was primarily attributable to the effect of price reductions and rebate programs for older versions of our dictation and other applications products in 1998 upon our introduction of new products and product enhancements and in response to competition, and to the increased percentage of tool licensing revenue which have a relatively lower cost of sales. Costs of consulting and services revenue as a percentage of such revenue increased to 61% in 1999 from 57% in 1998. The increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of a global management information system called PROMIS. During the last quarter of 1999, the introduction of this system caused a reduction in the efficiency of resources. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 71% to approximately $101.6 million, 30% of total revenues, in 1999 compared to approximately $59.4 million, 28% of total revenues, in 1998. Selling and marketing expense increased to approximately $65.8 million, 19% of total revenues, in 1999, compared to approximately $34.8 million, 16% of total revenues, in 1998. General and administrative expense increased to approximately $35.8 million, 10% of total revenues, in 1999 compared to approximately $24.6 million, 12% of total revenues, in 1998. The increase in marketing and sales expense was primarily attributable to increased sales as well as our increased marketing efforts relating to our introduction and building brand awareness for our dictation and other products in the retail channel. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to inclusion of general and administrative expenses for our acquired businesses for the periods after their acquisition, to increased personnel and related costs to support our revenue growth. Research and Development Expense, Net. Net research and development expense increased 97% to approximately $49.6 million, 15% of total revenues, in 1999 from $25.2 million, 12% of total revenues, in 1998. This 49 increase was primarily attributable to our increase in research and development efforts and personnel through acquisitions and internal growth to address our expansion in different markets, in particular the Asian markets, as well as to support our broader product and technology portfolio partly due to our acquisitions. Amortization and Write off of Goodwill. Our amortization of goodwill increased 62% to approximately $32.4 million, 9% of total revenues, in 1999 from $20.0 million, 9% of total revenues, in 1998. The increase reflects goodwill acquired by us in our acquisitions. Write off of In process Research and Development. In 1999, we did not record any write off of in process research and development in connection with our acquisitions during that period. In 1998, we recorded total charges of $79.4 million, 38% of total revenues, in connection with our acquisitions consummated during that period. These charges represented managements assessment of the value attributed to the research and development of the acquired businesses for products for which technological feasibility had not yet been established. See note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Other Operating Expense. In 1999, we did not incur any other operating expense. This compares to approximately $1.8 million of such expense in 1998. The expenses in 1998 consisted primarily of transition expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the consolidation of our operations. Total Other Expenses (Income). Our other expenses (income) includes interest income and expense, bank charges, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, our share in loss of unconsolidated affiliates and debt conversion expense. We recognized net other income of approximately $7.1 million in 1999 compared to net other expense of approximately $1.4 million in 1998. This change was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income, net of interest and other financing expenses, and a decrease in other expense, which was partially offset by a reduction of foreign exchange gains and an increase in share of loss of unconsolidated affiliates. This other income recognized in the 1999 period was primarily a result of net interest income attributable to our cash and investment balances, and to foreign exchange gains. Our interest income, net of interest and other financing expenses, increased slightly to approximately $6.3 million in 1999 from approximately $6.1 million in 1998. Our foreign exchange gains and losses have been primarily attributable to unrealized exchange gains resulting from the increase and decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Belgian franc and all other functional currency of our non U.S. subsidiaries, principally the Korean won and euro, as well as the increase and decrease in our dollar denominated assets. A significant portion of our cash and short term investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. Because our functional currency for our non U.S. operations is their local currency, we are required to recognize unrealized foreign exchange gains with respect to our U.S. dollar denominated assets of these operations when the value of the U.S. dollar increases in relation to their functional currency and unrealized foreign exchange losses when the relative value of the U.S. dollar decreases. Our foreign exchange gains were approximately $2.5 million in 1999 compared to a loss of approximately $81,000 in 1998. Our share in loss of unconsolidated affiliates decreased to approximately $1.6 million in 1999 from approximately $6.0 million in 1998. During 1998 we and our partner NDC reorganized our investments in OmniVoice, a joint venture formed to develop voice paging technology applications. Under this reorganization, we recorded a one time charge of approximately $4.1 million, which is reflected in share in loss of unconsolidated affiliates in 1998. Provision for Income Taxes (Benefit). In 1999, we recognized an income tax expense of approximately $27.1 million, compared to an income tax expense of approximately $5.1 million in 1998. The increase in our provision for income taxes reflects the depletion of the tax loss carry forwards of our Belgian parent Company, as well as tax charges for acquired businesses outside Belgium. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Minority Interest. Our minority interest expense net of tax benefit relates primarily to our share of the distribution obligations under the preferred income equity redeemable trust securities we issued in May 1998. Our minority interest expense increased to approximately $4.5 million in 1999 compared to approximately $2.4 million in 1998. 1998 Compared with 1997 50 Revenues. Total revenues increased 113% to approximately $211.6 million in 1998 from approximately $99.4 million in 1997. This increase was attributable to increases in revenues of all of our divisions. Technologies and solutions revenue increased by 148% to approximately $82.8 million in 1998 from approximately $33.4 million in 1997. Revenues in this division from the telecommunications market increased to approximately $12.8 million in 1998 from approximately $3.7 million in 1997; from the personal computer, multimedia and embedded markets increased to approximately $27.3 million in 1998 from approximately $20.3 million in 1997; and from intelligent content management market to approximately $23.2 million in 1998 from approximately $2.0 million in 1997. In 1998, our license revenue in this division also included approximately $10.5 million in nonrefundable up front license fees from strategic partners in connection with the license of our development tools to develop additional language versions of our core speech and language technology products, compared to no such revenue in 1997. Our 1998 technologies and solutions revenue also included approximately $9.0 million of engineering revenue in connection with our Dictation Consortium and Brussels Translation Group projects, compared to $7.6 million of such revenue in 1997. Speech and language applications revenue increased by 77.6% to approximately $60.9 million in 1998 from approximately $34.3 million in 1997. Revenue from our industry solutions increased to approximately $21.5 million in 1998 from approximately $5.7 million in 1997; and revenue from the retail and professional market increased to approximately $19.9 million in 1998 from approximately $2.2 million in 1997. In 1998, our license revenue in this division also included approximately $10.5 million in nonrefundable up front license fees from strategic partners in connection with the license of our development tools to develop additional language versions of our core speech and language technology products, compared to no such revenue in 1997. Our 1998 technologies and solutions revenue also included $9.0 million of engineering revenue in connection with our Dictation Consortium and Brussels Translation Group projects, compared to $26.3 million of such revenue in 1997. Consulting and services revenue increased by 114% to approximately $67.9 million in 1998 from approximately $31.7 million in 1997. This increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of additional translation services businesses as well as internal growth. Revenues from Microsoft and its affiliates constituted 27% of consulting and services revenue in 1998 and 33% in 1997. Cost of Sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to 33% in 1998 from 39% in 1997. This decrease was primarily attributable to an improvement in margins of all of our divisions. Costs of technologies and solutions revenue as a percentage of such revenue decreased to 15% in 1998 from 20% in 1997. Our improvement in margins for these revenues was primarily attributable to a more favorable mix of sales of products and technologies with relatively lower cost of sales in 1998 compared to 1997. Core technology license revenue in 1998 included revenues relating to our licensing of development tools to strategic partners for the development of additional language versions of our core technologies and products, for which we have incurred limited costs. Costs of speech and language applications revenue as a percentage of such revenue decreased to 29% in 1998 from 37% in 1997. This improvement was primarily attributable to the increased percentage of tool licensing revenue which have a relatively lower cost of sales. Cost of consulting and services revenue as a percentage of such revenues decreased to 57% in 1998 from 61% in 1997. This decrease was primarily attributable to volume related efficiencies. Selling, General and Administrative Expense. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 128% to approximately $59.4 million, 28% of total revenues, in 1998 from approximately $26.0 million, 26% of total revenues, in 1997. Selling and marketing expense increased to approximately $34.8 million, 16% of total revenues, in 1998 compared to approximately $12.5 million, 13% of total revenue, in 1997. General and administrative expense increased to approximately $24.6 million, 12% of total revenues, in 1998 compared to approximately $13.5 million, 14% of total revenue, in 1997. The increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily attributable to increased sales as well as our increased marketing efforts relating to our introduction and building brand awareness for our dictation and other products in the retail channel. The increase in general and administrative expense was 51 primarily attributable to inclusion of general and administrative expenses for our acquired businesses for the periods after their acquisition. Research and Development Expense, Net. Net research and development expense increased 294% to approximately $25.2 million, 12% of total revenues, in 1998 from approximately $6.4 million, 6% of total revenues, in 1997. This increase was primarily attributable to inclusion of research and development expenses for our acquired businesses for the periods after their acquisition, increased staffing and reallocation of personnel working previously under our agreement with Dictation Consortium to research and development. Amortization and Write off of Goodwill. Our amortization of goodwill increased 193% to approximately $20.0 million, 9% of total revenues, in 1998, from approximately $6.8 million, 7% of total revenues, in 1997. The increase reflects goodwill acquired by us in our recent acquisitions. We periodically evaluate goodwill to assess recoverability and any impairments that would be recognized in operating results if a permanent impairment were to occur. As a result of this evaluation, we wrote off approximately $3.7 million of goodwill in the 1998 period attributable to its acquisition, in November 1996, of Berkeley Speech Technologies, Inc. and BeSTspeech Products, Inc. Write off of In process Research and Development. In 1998, we recorded total charges of $79.4 million, 37.5% of total revenues, in connection with our acquisitions consummated during that period. In 1997, we recorded total charges of acquired in process research and development of $33.8 million. These charges represented managements assessment of the value attributed to the research and development of the acquired businesses for products for which technological feasibility had not yet been established. See note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Other Operating Expense. In 1998, our other operating expense increased to $1.8 million from $1.4 million in 1997. These expenses primarily consisted of transition expenses incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the consolidation of our operations. Total Other Expenses (Income). Our other expenses (income) include interest income and expense, bank charges, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses, our share in loss of unconsolidated affiliates and debt conversion expense. We recognized net other expense of approximately $1.4 million in 1998 compared to net other expense of approximately $812,000 in 1997. This change was primarily attributable to a reduction of foreign exchange gains and an increase in share of loss of unconsolidated affiliates, which was partially offset by an increase in interest income, net of interest and other financing expenses. Our interest income, net of interest and other financing expenses, increased to approximately $6.1 million in 1998, compared to a net expense of approximately $1.2 million in 1997. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to increased interest income resulting from our investment of net proceeds received from our public offering of common stock in September 1997 and our offering of preferred income equity redeemable trust securities (the \"PIERS\") in May 1998. Prior to our September 1997 offering, we also increased our average borrowings under our bank lines of credit. In 1998 we recognized approximately $81,000 of foreign exchange losses compared to approximately $4.8 million of foreign exchange gains in 1997. Our share in loss of unconsolidated affiliates increased to approximately $6.0 million in 1998 from approximately $1.1 million in 1997. This increase was primarily attributable to a charge of approximately $4.1 million incurred by us in 1998 in connection with our investment in OmniVoice. Provision for Income Taxes (Benefit). In 1998 we recognized an income tax expense of approximately $5.1 million, as compared to an income tax benefit of approximately $1.4 million in 1997. The increase in our provision for income taxes reflects tax charges for acquired businesses outside of Belgium. Minority Interest. Our minority interest expense net of tax benefit relates primarily to our share of the distribution obligations under the preferred income equity redeemable trust securities we issued in May 1998. Our minority interest expense increased to approximately $2.4 million in 1998 compared to $24,000 of income in 1997. Liquidity and Capital Resources 52 For the last three years we have funded our operations primarily through sales of securities, cash flow from operating activities and bank borrowings. At December 31, 1999, we had working capital of approximately $142.7 million, including approximately $130.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 1999, we had the following notes payable, credit facilities and long term debt outstanding in the aggregate amount of $42.9 million, including current installments of $24.2 million. The notes payable, credit facilities and bank loans bear interest at varying rates, which ranged from 5.5% to 13.0% at December 31, 1999. . Convertible note payable to Linguex S.A. of $4.9 million. This note was converted into 92,301 shares of our common stock on January 27, 2000. . An aggregate of approximately $10.5 million of notes payable to several Korean banks maturing in 2000 with interest yield percentages ranging from 9.30% to 13.0%. . An aggregate of $20.7 million in borrowing capacity under credit facilities with Bank Artesia and Bank BACOB. Bank Artesia and Bank BACOB merged in 1999. At December 31, 1999, the Company had $3.1 million outstanding under these credit facilities, which have expiration dates ranging from June 30, 2000 through February 28, 2001. . Convertible Subordinated Notes due November 15, 2001 in the aggregate principal amount of $3.6 million. These notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of approximately $5.1256 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits and other circumstances. . Non transferable bond issued in connection with the acquisition of GMS in the amount of approximately $2.3 million. The bond is payable on demand on or after May 2000. . Bank Artesia loans in the total outstanding principle amount of approximately $3.1 million. These notes are due on June 30, 2000. . General Bank loan in the outstanding principle amount of approximately $651,000. The loan is payable in monthly installments through June 2009. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the Mendez headquarters building. . BFG Bank AG loan, in the outstanding principal amount of approximately $2.6 million. The loan is payable in semi annual installments through March 31, 2007. The loan is secured by a mortgage on real estate owned by us in Wuppertal, Germany. . Artesia Leasing & renting capital lease in the amount of approximately $8.2 million for our headquarters building. . Other obligations, including obligations under capital leases in the total amount of approximately $6.6 million. In addition to these obligations, as of December 31, 1999, we were committed to pay up to a maximum amount of approximately $9.7 million in connection with our acquisitions, over periods extending up to two years based upon the performance of the acquired businesses. In May and June 1998, L&H Capital Trust I issued an aggregate of $156 million in principal amount of trust preferred income equity redeemable securities (\"PIERS\") and an aggregate of $4,824,800 of common securities. We hold all of the common securities. The sole asset of the Trust is an aggregate of $160,824,800 in principal amount of our 4.75% convertible subordinated debentures due in 2008. The terms and interest payments on these debentures correspond to the terms and dividend payments on the trust preferred income equity securities. We may elect to defer interest payments on the debentures for a period up to 20 consecutive quarters, causing distributions on the trust preferred income equity securities to be deferred as well. The trust preferred income equity securities are convertible into shares of our Common Stock. In case of a deferral, interest and distributions will continue to accrue, along with quarterly compounding interest on the deferred amounts. We may redeem all or a portion of the debentures after July 1, 2002 for cash or common stock, requiring an equal amount of trust preferred income equity securities to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid distributions. As of December 31, 1999, there were $146.7 million PIERS outstanding. In 1999, our operating activities provided approximately $69.2 million of cash. Our non cash expenses included approximately $32.4 million of amortization of goodwill, $7.3 million of amortization of other intangibles including software development costs, and $7.1 million of depreciation. An increase in accrued expenses net of a decrease in accounts payable also provided $2.3 million of cash. Our uses of cash included an increase in accounts receivable by approximately $30.2 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to our increased revenues. 53 In 1999, our investing activities used approximately $156.2 million of cash, including approximately $111.6 million for acquisitions, approximately $24.8 million for the acquisition of licenses and software development costs capitalized, approximately $10.5 million in additions to property and equipment, and approximately $6.0 million of investments in associated companies. On May 5, 2000, we acquired Dictaphone Corporation. In connection with that acquisition we were required to assume or refinance approximately $430 million of Dictaphone debt and other obligations. Dresdner Bank Luxembourg S.A., Deutsche Bank N.V., Artesia Banking Corporation N.V., KBC Bank N.V. and Fortis Bank N.V. collectively provided a total of $430 million in financing in connection with the acquisition. The acquisition financing consisted of a $200 million short term debt facility due March 31, 2001 which bears interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis points and a $230 million five year declining balance facility which bears interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points. In addition, Deutsche Bank has provided an ongoing $20 million revolving credit facility to Dictaphone which bears interest at LIBOR plus 125 basis points. These credit facilities are unsecured and contain financial and other covenants, including a covenant not to borrow any additional amounts under our existing credit facilities. Borrowings under the five year facility will be for renewable terms of up to six months and therefore may be required to be accounted for as short term debt. Initial funding of $200 million under the short term facility and $30 million under the five year facility was used to repay Dictaphones existing bank debt, to satisfy other obligations in connection with the acquisition and to cover closing costs. The remaining committed amount will be available to cover the $200 million of Dictaphones senior subordinated notes, should they be put to the company within 90 days of the closing by the noteholders at 101% of par, as permitted by the terms of the notes. These notes are also redeemable by Dictaphone at a declining rate beginning at 105.875% of par commencing in August 2000. In June 2000, we acquired Dragon Systems, Inc. in an all stock transaction. In connection with that acquisition, we repaid a $3 million term loan on behalf of Dragon. Since December 31, 1999 through June 8, 2000, we acquired additional businesses, other than Dictaphone and Dragon, for a total purchase price of approximately $69 million, consisting of approximately $64 million in cash and the issuance of approximately 104,000 shares of common stock. In addition, we are required to pay up to an additional $23 million for these acquisitions if performance targets are met. In May 2000, we entered into an agreement to acquire additional assets of Rodeer Systems, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25 million in cash. In 1999, our financing activities provided us approximately $29.3 million of cash, primarily attributable to approximately $57.7 million from the sale of common stock, including approximately $15.0 million from the investment by Microsoft and approximately $28.0 million from the investment by Intel. These sources of cash were partially offset by a total of approximately $32.1 million in repayment of our long term debt and capital lease obligations. We are a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit which alleges, in general, that we improperly accounted for write offs of in process research and development in connection with certain acquisitions. The lawsuit contends that the Company `s actions violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"34 Act\") and Rule 10b 5 promulgated under the 34 Act. Plaintiffs filed these lawsuits on behalf of all purchasers of the Companys common stock during varying periods which range from as early as April 28, 1997 through December 4, 1998. These plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys and experts fees and other relief. We believe that the claims are groundless and are vigorously defending ourselves. Nevertheless, class action litigation can be expensive and time consuming. Although we cannot make any guarantees regarding the outcome of these actions, we believe that the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We believe that our existing resources, including our new bank lines of credit, and the anticipated cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we intend to seek additional sources of cash during the year to increase our financial flexibility or to fund acquisitions. The sufficiency of our resources to fund working capital needs is subject to known and unknown risks, 54 uncertainties and other factors which may materially harm our business, including without limitation the risk factors set forth in this Report. Acquired In Process Technology We incurred in process research and development charges totaling approximately $79.4 million in 1998 and $33.8 million in 1997. These charges related primarily to our acquisitions of GMS, Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, AppTek, Dictation Consortium, Globalink and TikSoft. We determined these valuations giving explicit consideration to the Securities and Exchange Commissions views on purchased in process research and development as set forth in its September 9, 1998 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants SEC Regulations Committee (the \"AICPA Letter\"). These valuations were further based upon appraisals prepared by an independent appraiser experienced in evaluating in process research and development. A description of our valuation methodology used and a comparison of our actual results through December 31, 1998, and assumptions used in those valuations for our acquisitions of GMS, Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, AppTek, Dictation Consortium, Globalink and TikSoft are set forth below. Our assumptions in determining the value of acquired in process projects included the following: (1) Projected net revenues and cash flows from the projects prepared by us and management of the seller. (2) The expected duration of the revenue streams from the acquired projects, which ranged from two to seven years. (3) A percentage of completion for each project estimated by considering a number of factors, including (a) the costs invested to date relative to the expected total cost of the development effort and (b) the amount of progress completed as of the transaction date relative to the overall technological achievements required to complete the project. The technological achievements were generally addressed by our technical representatives and those of the seller. (4) A discount rate was used to discount to present value the cash flows associated with the respective in process projects. Discounting the net cash flows back to their present value was based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise, based on various required rates of return from investments in various areas of that enterprise. The WACC which we assumed for the acquisitions as corporate business enterprises ranged from 18% to 22%. The discount rates which we used in discounting the net cash flows from acquired in process technology ranged from 22% to 35%. These discount rates are higher than the WACC due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimates described above, including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology, the useful life of such technology, the profitability levels of such technology, and the uncertainty of technological advances that are unknown at a given time. The nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning, designing, coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that we are able to produce the product to meet its design requirements, including functions, features and technical performance requirements. At the time of the acquisitions, we expected that additional costs and time would be required to complete these development projects. However, at such time we could not assure that we would achieve technical or commercial viability with respect to these or any other of the products under development. Furthermore, future developments by our competitors, changes in technology, changes in other products and services, or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon these plans. Our failure to complete the development of the acquired development projects in a timely manner or within budget, or to successfully commercialize these projects if developed, could materially harm our business. Since the acquisitions, we have used the acquired in process technology to develop new products, which have or are expected to become part of our product lines when completed. However, we are constantly reviewing the allocation of our research and development resources to respond to the ever changing market and technology developments, as well as developments of our own internally developed and acquired evolving technology portfolio. In reaction to these changing dynamics, in addition to completing many of our acquired research and development 55 projects, we have combined acquired research and development projects with other of our development activities, and we have delayed or terminated other projects. Our acquired in process research and development projects were primarily attributable to machine translation and dictation and other continuous speech recognition projects. Our research and development activities for our acquired machine translation projects have been affected by a shift in our focus from developing a broad range of applications using machine translation to developing a comprehensive machine translation Internet translation solution for a broad range of language pairs. This change in focus was affected by the proliferation of the use of the Internet, and in particular the projected growth of Internet use by non English speakers. In addition, advances in computer technology have enabled personal computers to perform functions that previously required more powerful centralized computers. We believe that these advances made some of our acquired server based machine translation applications projects less desirable. As a result of our changed focus, we were able to successfully implement translation services over the Microsoft Internet network in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, but have discontinued or delayed projects involving separate applications of our machine translation technology. Our estimates of our expenditures incurred in completing our acquired in process machine translation projects are consistent with our initial expectations. However, there has been an initial shortfall in revenues from our assumptions used in valuing our acquired in process machine translation technology, which we attribute primarily to delays associated with our refocus on Internet translation. If we are not successful in implementing our Internet translation projects, we may be unable to realize the value assigned to this in process technology. In addition, the value of the other acquired intangible assets associated with this technology may also become impaired. We have completed our in process research and development projects relating to dictation and continuous speech recognition engines. These completed projects form a technology base for our growing business and opportunities in this field. Both the cost and revenue we have received from these projects have been consistent with initial estimates. However, we cannot assure that in future periods actual results will not deviate from our initial assumptions. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (\"SFAS 133\"). SFAS 133 requires that derivative instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on their fair values. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments will be recorded either in results of operations or in other comprehensive income, depending on the intended use of the derivative instrument. The initial application of SFAS will be reported as the effect of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 133, as amended, is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We will adopt the requirements of SFAS 133 in our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2001. We have not yet determined the effect that the adoption of SFAS 133 will have on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. On March 31, 2000, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation An Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25 (\"FIN 44\"). FIN 44 provides guidance for issues that have arisen in applying Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. FIN 44 applies prospectively to new awards, exchanges of awards in a business combination, modifications to outstanding awards, and changes in grantee status that occur on or after July 1, 2000. We have not yet determined the effect that the provisions of FIN 44 will have on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Year 2000 Readiness We did not experience any material difficulties related to the Year 2000 problem on December 31, 1999 and have not experienced any such difficulties that we are aware of since that date. In addition, our operations have not, to date, been adversely affected by any difficulties experienced by any of its suppliers or customers in connection with the Year 2000 problem. We intend to continue to monitor our systems for potential difficulties through the remainder of this year. Risk Factors 56 Risks Related to our Business Our business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of businesses that we acquire. As part of our business strategy, we have in the past and expect to continue to acquire other businesses and technologies. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including: . the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses; . the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; . the difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology; . unanticipated expenses and delays relating to completing acquired development projects and technology integration; . the management of geographically remote units; . the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; . the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel; . risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience; . the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies; and . potential unknown liabilities or other difficulties associated with acquired businesses. We have recently acquired Dictaphone and Dragon; these significant acquisitions will require substantial integration and management efforts. As a result of these and other risks, we may not realize anticipated benefits from the acquisitions. Failure to achieve these benefits could materially harm our business. Our operating results may be harmed by the manner in which we are required to account for our acquisitions. We are currently required to account for acquisitions under the purchase method. This approach has resulted and may continue to result in a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which create substantial ongoing amortization charges to our income over the useful lives of the assets acquired. Moreover, the inability to achieve expected results during the anticipated useful life of acquired goodwill could result in unanticipated charges to income and significant losses. For example, in 1998 we wrote off all of the goodwill acquired from Berkeley Speech Technologies, Inc. as a result of our inability to complete Berkeleys product line. As of December 31, 1999, we had approximately $411 million of goodwill, as a result of our acquisitions. Our business could be harmed by acquisitions we complete in the future. We may not be able to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates on reasonable terms, if at all. Acquisitions may involve expending significant funds, incurring additional debt or the issuance of additional securities, which may materially harm our business and dilute our stockholders. If we expend significant funds or incur additional debt, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and we may be more vulnerable to economic down turns and competitive pressures. We may have difficulty managing our growing number of employees, our new divisions and our planned new entities. We have experienced a period of rapid growth. From December 31, 1997 through December 31, 1999, the total number of our employees grew from approximately 1,100 to almost 1,900, and, following our recent acquisitions of Dictaphone, Dragon and companies in the transcription business, the total number of our employees now exceeds 5,000. In addition, since September 1996, through acquisitions and internal growth, we added three new divisions (dictation technologies, translation services and language technologies) to our core speech technologies division. In January 1999, we reorganized these divisions into our present three division corporate structure. During 1999, we announced plans to create separate entities for several of our key business areas: Globalization and Internet Translation and Healthcare Applications & Solutions, as well as Enterprise and Telephony Solutions and Automotive Solutions. We also continue to review our business structure. Our changing business will require considerable investment of our management resources. Our failure to manage our growing and changing business effectively 57 could result in an interruption or loss of momentum that could materially harm our business. To help manage our changing business, we intend to strengthen: . management; . financial and operational controls; and . operational, financial and management information systems. Any delay or failure to successfully implement these improvements could materially harm our business. We may not be able to sustain our recent profitability. Although we have been able to achieve profitability for fiscal year 1999, we have had a history of substantial losses and may not be able to sustain our recent profitability. In 1997 and 1998, write offs of in process research and development associated with acquisitions completed in those periods adversely impacted our net income. Through December 31, 1999, we had accumulated net losses of approximately $107.9 million, including net losses of approximately $13.3 million in 1997, $52.7 million in 1998 and a net income of $41.7 million in 1999. Expenses during these periods included write offs of acquired in process research and development of approximately $33.8 million in 1997, and $79.4 million in 1998. We intend to continue to acquire businesses, products and technologies. Future acquisitions may result in additional significant acquired in process research and development write offs, significant amortization of goodwill and other charges related to acquisitions. Future operating results could also be materially harmed by many other factors, both known and unknown, including those risk factors described below. We depend upon the continued services of our executive officers and key research and development personnel with expertise in speech and language technologies and with multilingual skills. The loss of any of our executive officers or key research and development personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Our success will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for personnel, particularly software engineers, speech scientists and linguists, is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business. We do not have any key man life insurance for any of our officers or other key personnel. The speech and language technologies industry is relatively new, and a market for our products may never fully develop. Because the speech and language technologies industry is relatively new and rapidly evolving, it is difficult to accurately predict demand and market acceptance for our recently introduced products and products under development. Increased acceptance of our products and technologies will depend upon: . the development of our targeted markets; . the performance and price of our products, our customers and their competitors products; . customer service; and . customer reaction to those products. The development of the speech and language technologies markets also will depend upon: . the growth of third party applications incorporating our products and technologies; . the demand for new applications; . the ability of our products and technologies to meet and adapt to these needs; and . continuing price and performance improvements in hardware technology that we expect to reduce the cost and increase the performance of products incorporating our products and technologies. These markets may not develop further and our products may not achieve market acceptance. We must adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements to remain competitive. 58 The market for our products has been characterized by: . rapid technological change; . frequent product introductions; and . evolving customer requirements. We believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to: . enhance our existing products; . develop successfully new products that meet increasing customer requirements; and . gain market acceptance. To achieve these goals, we will need to continue to make substantial investments in product development and marketing. We may not: . have sufficient resources to make these investments; . be successful in developing product enhancements or new products on a timely basis, if at all; or . be able to market successfully these enhancements and new products once developed. Further, our products may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology. To succeed we must develop and integrate new products and enhance the performance of existing products on a timely basis and within budget. Developing and applying our technology has required, and will continue to require, substantial technical innovations. Once we have developed, acquired or licensed a technology, we must adapt that technology to meet the specific requirements of the application in which it is to be integrated. The adaptation process can be time consuming and costly to both us and our customers. The quality and resulting market acceptance of the end product may depend, to a substantial extent, upon the success of this adaptation. We may not be successful in developing new products, integrating new technologies, or enhancing the performance of our existing products on a timely basis or within budget, if at all. Our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected errors or defects or do not meet customer specifications. We are continuously developing new products and technologies and improving our existing products and technologies. Newly introduced products and technologies can contain undetected errors or defects. In addition, these products or technologies may not meet their performance specifications under all conditions or for all applications. If, despite our internal testing and testing by our customers, any of our products or technologies contain errors or defects or any of our products or technologies fail to meet customer specifications, then we may be required to enhance or improve those products or technologies. We may not be able to do so on a timely basis, if at all, and may only be able to do so at considerable expense. Although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, we cannot guarantee that the coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim. Despite the existence of the insurance, any significant reliability problems could result in adverse customer reaction and negative publicity and could materially harm our business. We face significant competition which could result in decreased demand for our products or services. We may not be able to compete successfully. A number of companies have developed, or are expected to develop, products that compete or will compete with our products. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. Competitors in the speech and language technologies markets include: 59 . Apple Computer, Inc.; . Bowne International, Inc.; . IBM; . Lucent Technologies; . Microsoft Corporation; . Motorola; . NEC Corp.; . Nuance; . Philips Electronics N.V.; . SpeechWorks International, Inc.; . Systran Corp.; and . Texas Instruments Incorporated. IBM and Philips have introduced dictation products which compete directly with our dictation products. We also compete with other smaller companies which have developed advanced speech and language technology products. Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the abilities of their advanced speech and language technology products to address the needs of our prospective customers. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. The translation services market is also highly competitive. Although none of the current participants in this market has a significant market share, we have numerous competitors with significant resources (such as Bowne International). Our quarterly technologies revenue may fluctuate significantly because a significant portion of these revenues has been attributable to up front payments. A significant portion of our technologies revenue have been attributable to up front revenue, including up front license fees from strategic partners for the licensing of development tools for the development of additional language versions and language translation pairs for our products. We recognized this revenue upon execution of license agreements or upon acceptance by our customers of our technology under these agreements. This revenue may significantly fluctuate each quarter. These potential fluctuations will depend upon the number, size and nature of license agreements into which we enter. We expect that ongoing license revenue from sales of products incorporating our technology, as well as sales of our own products, will also fluctuate each quarter. The fluctuations will be based on a number of factors, including: . the size and timing of individual license transactions by our customers; . the potential for delay or deferral of customer implementation of our technology; . the timing of our introduction of new products or product enhancements; . the timing of our competitors introduction of new products or product enhancements; . seasonality of technology purchases; and . other general economic conditions. Our revenues from our consumer products for the personal computer market may be seasonal with lower revenues in our first two quarters and higher revenues in the fourth quarter, and may further fluctuate significantly based upon the timing of new product introductions. We recently introduced consumer products for the personal computer market, including continuous dictation products. Our revenues from sales in this market may be seasonal with higher revenues in the fourth quarter. Our revenues from these products can also vary significantly depending upon the timing of new product introductions. Our revenues from the consulting and services division may be seasonal with higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters. 60 Our consulting and services division derives significant revenue from the computer, consumer, telephony and automotive industries. These revenues, which tend to track the product release cycles of these industries, are somewhat seasonal, with comparatively higher revenues in the third and fourth quarters. We have significant fixed costs which are not easily reduced if revenues fall below expectations. A high percentage of our operating expenses is relatively fixed. We likely will not be able to reduce spending to compensate for adverse fluctuations in revenues. Accordingly, shortfalls in revenues are likely to materially adversely affect our operating results. Our business may be harmed by changes in the relative level of revenues among our lines of business which have significantly different profit margins. Changes in the relative level of revenues among our lines of business could materially adversely affect our gross profit margins and other results of operations. Our lines of business have different profit margins. For the year ended December 31, 1999, gross profit margins in our three divisions were as follows: Division Gross Profit Margin Technologies and solutions 85.8% Applications 83.2% Consulting and Services 39.4% The growth of translation services revenues in relation to our other businesses would result in a reduction in our overall gross profit margins. Our international business operations expose us to difficulties in coordinating our international activities and dealing with multiple regulatory environments, as well as to risks of international political and economic conditions. Our worldwide business may be materially adversely affected by: . difficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries; . greater difficulties in trade accounts receivable collection; . possibly adverse tax consequences; . governmental currency controls; . changes in various regulatory requirements; . political and economic changes and disruptions; . export/import controls; and . tariff regulations. In addition, a significant portion of our executive offices and our research and development operations are located in Belgium. Therefore, our operations and the market price of the common stock may also be affected by adverse economic conditions in Belgium. Likewise, we have recently substantially increased our revenues in Korea and elsewhere in the Far East. Our operations and our ability to continue to generate significant revenues in Korea and the Far East may be affected by adverse economic conditions or political instability in Korea or other countries in the Far East, as well as other external business risks. 61 Fluctuations in the exchange rates, in relation to the U.S. dollar, of our functional currency, the Belgian franc, the Euro and the other foreign currencies in which we conduct our business may harm our operating results. We generate sales primarily in U.S. dollars and incur expenses in a number of currencies; principally in the U.S. dollar, the Belgian franc, the Euro and other currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the Belgian franc, U.S. dollar and foreign currencies have caused, and are likely to continue to cause, amounts translated into U.S. dollars to fluctuate in comparison with previous periods. In particular, an increase in the value of the Belgian franc in relation to the U.S. dollar would likely increase our expenses relative to U.S. dollar sales and could materially harm our business. Because our functional currency for our Belgian operations is the Belgian franc, we recognize unrealized foreign exchange gains with respect to our assets denominated in U.S. dollars when the value of the U.S. dollar increases in relation to the Belgian franc. Conversely, we recognize unrealized foreign exchange losses when the relative value of the U.S. dollar decreases. Since 1996, we have not entered into any exchange rate hedging transactions. We may, however, enter into hedging contracts in the future. Our decision not to enter into hedging transactions has been primarily attributable to: . our perception of the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the Belgian franc; and . our receipt of substantial sums of Belgian francs from capital transactions, principally the exercise of warrants. We cannot guarantee that the U.S. dollar will continue to be stronger than the Belgian franc or that we will continue to receive revenues denominated in Belgian francs or raise capital in Belgian francs. Exchange rate fluctuations, whether or not we enter into hedge transactions, may materially harm our business. We rely on our customers, some of whom are our competitors, to develop applications for our products, market products incorporating our technology and generate license revenues for us. Many of our core speech products are licensed primarily to applications developers, original equipment manufacturers, component manufacturers and software vendors which incorporate our technology into applications developed by them and sold to end users. The success of these licensed products depends to a substantial degree on the efforts of others in developing and marketing products incorporating our technology. Our customers often require several months to integrate our technologies into their products. Although we have entered into numerous license agreements with customers, to date we have received significant recurring license revenues from only a limited number of customers. Products incorporating our technology will not necessarily be successfully implemented or marketed by our customers. Our customers, such as Microsoft, have also developed or acquired products or technologies that compete with our technology. These customers may give higher priority to the sale of these competitive products or technologies. Few of our customers have any exclusive purchase obligations under their license agreements with us. Changes in our relationship with Microsoft, one of our largest customers and a strategic partner, could harm our business. An adverse change in our relationship with Microsoft could have a material adverse effect on our business. On September 11, 1997, we announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft to accelerate development of speech products in multiple languages running on Microsoft Windows platforms. As part of this strategic alliance, Microsoft now holds 7,515,124 shares of our common stock which represented approximately 5.29% of our outstanding common stock on June 8, 2000. Microsoft has also exercised its registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock purchased under the Microsoft purchase agreement and issuable under the warrants. Microsofts representative, Bernard Vergnes, was elected to our Board of Directors in May 1998 pursuant to Microsofts right under the purchase agreement to cause one Microsoft nominee to be elected to the Board of Directors. In addition, we entered into a license agreement with Microsoft under which we granted Microsoft exclusive licenses of patent rights, in defined areas, and received a non exclusive cross license of Microsoft patent rights. Microsoft has the right to terminate the license if L&H Holding N.V. transfers its control over L&H to a third party as a result of L&H Holdings transfer of our common stock. 62 The relationship with Microsoft may preclude or limit our ability to enter into similar license arrangements or relationships with others. Sales to Microsoft accounted for 12% of our total revenues in 1998 and 9% of our total revenues in 1999. Microsoft has also entered into nonexclusive license agreements with us for many of our core speech technologies. A reduction of revenues from Microsoft could have a material adverse effect upon our business and prospects. We may be overly dependent on our strategic partners, and the manner in which we have structured these partnerships, including our exclusive licensing of technology, could harm our business. We are dependent on our strategic partners in connection with our research and development efforts. Our agreements with our strategic partners may include an exclusive license of our technology for the development of specified technologies or products. For example, we are relying primarily on strategic partners for the development of our technologies in new languages, including Thai, Thamil, Hindi, Vietnamese, Urdu, Malay, Taiwanese, Arabic, Armenian, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Greek, Bahassa, Turkish, and various Scandinavian languages. Similarly we are relying primarily on strategic partners to develop machine translation language pairs outside our core language groups. Pursuant to the agreements relating to these ventures, we have exclusively licensed our technology to our strategic partners. Our strategic partners also have exclusive rights to develop, market and distribute products incorporating the developed technology for specified languages. Further, subject to our underlying rights and our rights in jointly developed technology or products, our strategic partners will own the technology and products developed pursuant to these agreements. We have also entered into a non exclusive license and development agreement with Sail Labs to support the long term development of advanced speech and language technologies and products based on our technologies. We generally have limited or no control over the operations of our strategic ventures, including with respect to the amount and timing of resources that our strategic partners devote to these ventures. As a result, our strategic partners may not perform their obligations as expected. In addition, in the event that our strategic relationships are terminated, we may not be able to continue to maintain or develop strategic relationships or to replace strategic partners. Further, some of our partners are newly formed companies and do not have any history of operations or development or commercialization of speech or language technologies or products. Therefore, we cannot assure that our strategic partnerships will be successful. If our strategic partnerships are terminated or otherwise fail to meet our expectations, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business as expected which may materially harm our business. In addition, in cases where we have exclusively licensed rights or technology, we may be precluded from developing products and technology internally. We may also be precluded from owning or controlling developments to and new products based on our technology, which may materially harm our business. Further, our strategic partners may become competitors, which may lead to conflicts of interest. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully, if at all, with our strategic partners or that any conflicts with our strategic partners will be resolved in our favor, which may also materially harm our business. We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, patents, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Existing copyright laws afford only limited protection. We have obtained patents and will continue to make efforts to obtain patents, when available, in connection with our technologies. We seek to protect our software and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws, which afford only limited protection. Our pending patent applications or any future applications may not be approved. Any patents may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. Others may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours. To determine the priority of inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office or similar authorities in other countries. These proceedings could result in substantial cost to us. Such patent applications may have priority over our filed patent applications. 63 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We have a significant international presence and the laws of some foreign countries, including the laws of Belgium, may not protect our proprietary rights to the extent of the laws of the United States. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate. Our operations or products could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Others may assert that our technology and products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Any such assertion, if resolved adversely to us, may require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements and may materially harm our business. Our obligations under our preferred income equity redeemable securities and our debt facilities could prevent us from obtaining additional financing and harm our liquidity. In June 1998, we completed the sale of $156 million of 4.75% preferred income equity redeemable trust securities. In connection with the sale of these securities, we incurred both distribution obligations and $156 million in redemption obligations; approximately $125 million in principal amount of these securities were still outstanding as of May 31, 2000. In May 2000 we entered into various financing arrangements in connection with the acquisition of Dictaphone, including a $200 million short term facility due March 31, 2001 and a five year declining balance facility of $230 million which will be available to repay $200 million in senior subordinated notes of Dictaphone which may be put to the company within 90 days of the closing by the noteholders at 101% of par, pursuant to the terms of the notes. An aggregate of $230 million is currently outstanding under these facilities. These outstanding securities and our outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, working capital or other purposes. They could also make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. Our obligations under these securities and debt facilities could also adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a cash shortfall, we could be forced to reduce other expenditures to be able to meet our requirements with respect to these securities and our debt facilities. Our ability to meet these obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations. Many of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to meet our obligations under these securities and to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of these obligations or obtain additional financing. Our operating results could be harmed by our high balances of accounts receivable, some of which we may not be able to collect. We have historically had high balances of accounts receivable. These balances are high because a significant portion of our revenues had been attributable to nonrefundable, up front license fees that generally have payment terms of up to 90 days. As of December 31, 1999, we had accounts receivable of $104 million, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $9.3 million. We maintain credit procedures to evaluate the creditworthiness of prospective customers and employ personnel specifically for the purpose of monitoring and collecting accounts receivable. Despite adherence to these procedures, we may not be able to collect these receivables when they become payable and may further reduce the length of deferral of payment of up front fees. An unfavorable outcome or prolonged litigation in class action lawsuits filed against us, alleging that we improperly accounted for write offs of in process research and development, could harm our business. We are a defendant in a consolidated class action lawsuit which alleges, in general, that we improperly accounted for write offs of in process research and development. Plaintiffs filed these lawsuits on behalf of all purchasers of our common stock during varying periods that range from as early as April 28, 1997 through December 4, 1998. We believe that the claims are groundless and we are vigorously defending ourselves. Nevertheless, class action litigation can be extremely expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, we cannot make any guarantees regarding the outcome of these actions. An unfavorable outcome or prolonged litigation in this lawsuit could materially harm our business. 64 Because our founding stockholders have rights to control Lernout & Hauspie, decisions may be made by them that are detrimental to your interests. As of June 7, 2000, Messrs. Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, the founders, Co Chairmen and Managing Directors of Lernout & Hauspie, controlled 43,667,208 shares of common stock (including outstanding rights to acquire common stock) through various controlled entities (including (i) 9,064,329 shares of our common stock which were issued as consideration for the Dictaphone merger because the Stonington Fund has assigned certain voting rights to all the shares it acquired in the merger for so long as it holds the shares by agreeing to hold the shares through an entity controlled by Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie, (ii) 9,807,489 shares of our common stock which were issued to the principal stockholders of Dragon as consideration for the Dragon merger because these stockholders have assigned certain voting rights to all the shares they acquired in the merger for so long as they hold the shares by agreeing to hold the shares through entities controlled by Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie, and (iii) the securities acquired by Intel Atlantic which are exchangeable at any time into shares of our Automatically Convertible Stock held by a trust on behalf of Intel, as to which the voting rights, which are equivalent to the voting rights of 1,791,864 shares of our common stock, are controlled by Messrs. Lernout & Hauspie). As of that date, these shares represented approximately 30.24% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Members of the L&H Holding Control Group have entered into forward sale contracts with unaffiliated investment funds that require the members to transfer, on August 31, 2001, or an earlier date on the occurrence of a default, shares of common stock based upon the fair market value of the shares on the date of transfer. Under our restated articles of incorporation for so long as the L&H Holding Control Group owns at least 10% of our common stock, L&H Holding N.V., an entity controlled by Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie, has the right to nominate for election nine of our 17 directors. Accordingly, L&H Holding N.V. is able to control our Board of Directors and the direction of our affairs. In addition, by reason of L&H Holding Control Groups stock ownership, Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie are able to exert substantial influence over other actions requiring stockholders approval, including amendments to our restated articles of incorporation, mergers, sales of assets or other business acquisitions or dispositions. The L&H Holding Control Group agreed not to approve, propose or vote with respect to any capital increase of Lernout & Hauspie by way of a rights offering to existing Lernout & Hauspie stockholders on a preemptive basis or any resolution to pay a cash dividend on common stock, without the consent of the purchasers in the forward sales. The interest of Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie in ensuring that the L&H Holding Control Group maintains a 10% equity interest could cause Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie to cause us to take actions that may not be in your best interests, such as declining opportunities to acquire businesses or raise funds through issuances of our equity. Our interests may be in conflict with the interests of a number of entities in which our directors are involved; these conflicts could harm our business. In 1995, the Government of Flanders, together with Lernout & Hauspie and others, created the Flanders Language Valley V.Z.W., a not for profit entity, designed to foster the establishment and growth of enterprises near our headquarters in Flanders that seek to develop and commercialize products based upon advanced speech and language technology. Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie have been active promoters of the foundation but do not have any beneficial interest in the assets of the foundation. At the time of the formation of the foundation, a group of private investors formed the FLV Fund, a for profit limited partnership, to invest in high technology based companies that specialize in speech and language based products. In connection with its investment in Lernout & Hauspie, Microsoft has invested approximately $3.0 million in the FLV Fund. The FLV Fund is now publicly traded on EASDAQ. Lessius Management Consulting, N.V., Gewestelijke Investeringsmaatschappij Vlaanderen N.V. (\"GIMV\") and S.A.I.L Trust V.Z.W. each hold a one third interest in the Flanders Language Valley Fund Management N.V., the manager of the FLV Fund (the \"FLV Fund Manager\"). Lessius Management Consulting, N.V. is a subsidiary of a Belgian based investment bank, Lessius N.V. GIMV is one of our stockholders and has rights under our restated articles of incorporation to nominate one of our directors. S.A.I.L Trust V.Z.W. is a not for profit foundation formed in May 1998 by Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie and Mr. Fernand Cloet, one of our directors. The purpose of this foundation is to further support the economic development and to assist in the financing of the infrastructure and the 65 enhancement of the educational system of the Flanders Language Valley region. Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie have advised us that they do not have a beneficial interest in the assets of this foundation. Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie have used a portion of the purchase price received on their forward sales of common stock by the L&H Holding Control Group to provide initial funding for this foundation and may provide additional funding to the foundation in the future. In April 1999, we provided a short term bridge loan of approximately $1.6 million to an affiliate of the foundation to support ongoing development and construction projects in the Flanders region of Belgium so as to avoid possible delays in the construction schedules; this loan was repaid in full in December 1999. Messrs. Cloet, one of our current directors, and Philip Vermeulen, one of our former directors, currently serve as two of the nine directors of the FLV Fund Manager. Mr. Vermeulen also serves as an officer of the FLV Fund Manager. Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie served as directors of the FLV Fund Manager from its inception until their resignation on May 30, 1997. Pursuant to contractual rights obtained in May 1998 to nominate five members for election to the Board of Directors of the FLV Fund Manager, the S.AI.L Trust nominated two of the 10 members of the Board of Directors of the FLV Fund Manager, including its current chairman and Mr. Vermeulen. The stockholders of the FLV Fund Manager may increase the number of directors serving on the FLV Fund Managers board from 10 to 15. Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie have indicated that although they do not plan to rejoin the Board of Directors of the FLV Fund Manager, they intend to spend a portion of their time on the activities of the FLV Fund. In October 1998, Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie formed L&H Investment Company N.V. Messrs. Lernout and Hauspie beneficially own a controlling interest in and are co chairmen of L&H Investment Company. Another one of our directors, Mr. Francis Vanderhoydonck, also serves as President and Managing Director of L&H Investment Company. The principal purpose of L&H Investment Company is to invest in high technology based companies that specialize in speech and language based products. We do not have any interest as a stockholder, director or otherwise in L&H Investment Company. We have contractual rights with companies in which the FLV Fund and L&H Investment Company have invested. In addition, the companies in which either the FLV Fund or L&H Investment Company may invest in the future are likely to have contractual relations with us or may be our competitors. As a result of the conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of these overlapping relationships, including for example, the influence Messrs. Lernout, Hauspie and Cloet have over the Boards of Directors of these entities, our directors may make decisions on behalf of us involving the FLV Fund, L&H Investment Company or companies supported by them that are not in the best interest of us or our stockholders. Companies funded in part by the FLV Fund and L&H Investment Company accounted for approximately 3.7% of our revenues in 1998 and 0.3% of our revenues in 1999. The coordinated laws of commercial companies of Belgium do not permit Messrs. Lernout, Hauspie and Cloet or any other member of Lernout & Hauspie or the FLV Management N.V.s Board of Directors to participate in deliberations and decision making with respect to matters in which these individuals have a direct or indirect conflict of interest with Lernout & Hauspie or FLV Management N.V. Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Our Belgian Incorporation Provisions of our charter and contracts and of Belgian law may discourage takeover offers and may limit the price that investors would be willing to pay for our common stock. Laws and documents contain provisions that may discourage bids for Lernout & Hauspie. These include: . our restated articles of incorporation; . Belgian company law; . other provisions of Belgian law; and . our contractual arrangements which contain rights adverse to us if there is a change of control. These laws and arrangements could discourage advantageous offers for our business or common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock. Our restated articles of incorporation contain provisions permitting specified entities to nominate members of the maximum 17 member Board of Directors of Lernout & Hauspie as follows: 66 . L&H Holding N.V............................................ 9 Members . GIMV....................................................... 1 Member . Microsoft.................................................. 1 Member Microsoft may terminate our rights under our license agreement with it upon a change in control of Lernout & Hauspie. Our Board of Directors is permitted to issue preferred stock upon terms it deems appropriate without the prior approval of the holders of the common stock. Our ability to issue preferred stock in such a manner could enable our Board of Directors to prevent changes in our management or control. Belgian company law and other Belgian laws provide that takeover bids must be made for all outstanding voting securities of Lernout & Hauspie and are subject to the supervision and approval of the Commission for Banking and Finance in Belgium. In some instances, takeover bids must be approved by the competent Belgian and European antitrust authorities. Our incorporation in Belgium causes us to be governed by Belgian law which provides for different and in some cases more limited stockholder rights than the laws of jurisdictions in the United States. We are a Belgian corporation and our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and Belgian company law. Although provisions of Belgian company law resemble various provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states of the United States, principles of law relating to such matters as: . the validity of corporate procedures; . the fiduciary duties of management; and . the rights of our stockholders may differ from those that would apply if we were incorporated in a jurisdiction within the United States. For example, there is no statutory right of appraisal under Belgian law with respect to mergers, and the right for stockholders of a Belgian corporation to sue derivatively, on the corporations behalf, is limited. In addition, a provision of Belgian company law which recently became applicable to us restricts our ability to sell shares of our stock for a cash purchase price which is lower than the average price of our stock for the thirty days prior to issuance of the new shares unless we also offer to sell shares at such price to our existing stockholders. This restriction could inhibit our ability to raise capital in the future. You may be unable to serve legal process or enforce judgments against us and our directors and officers. We are a Belgian corporation and a substantial portion of our assets are located in Belgium. Most of our officers and directors and our independent auditors are not residents of the United States. Furthermore, all or a substantial portion of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, you may not be able to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons or to enforce any judgments of United States courts upon these people or us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities or other laws of the United States. We have been advised by our Belgian legal counsel, Loeff Claeys Verbeke, that civil liabilities under the securities and other laws of the United States may not be enforceable in original actions instituted in Belgium, or in actions instituted in Belgium to enforce judgments of United States courts. Actions for enforcement of judgments of United States courts might be successful only if the Belgian court confirms the substantive correctness of the judgment of the United States court, and is satisfied: . that the judgment is not contrary to the principles of public policy in Belgium or rules of Belgian public law; . that the judgment did not violate the rights of the defendant; . that the judgment is not subject to further appeal under United States law; . that the United States court did not accept its jurisdiction solely on the basis of the nationality of the plaintiff; and . as to the authenticity of the text of the judgment submitted to it. 67 The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect your investment in our stock. The market price of the common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. We believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of the common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including: . announcements of developments related to our business; . quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels; . general conditions in the worldwide economy; . announcements of technological innovations; . new products or product enhancements by us or ourcompetitors; . developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation; and . developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers. In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of small capitalization and \"high tech\" companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and the market price of the common stock may decline. 68 Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are: . interest rates on debt; and . foreign exchange rates. The following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analytical techniques are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets. The analysis methods that we use to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and overall financing strategies using a combination of short term and long term debt with either fixed or variable interest rates. We generally do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments. Assuming December 31, 1999 variable rate debt levels of approximately $3.4 million, a one point change in interest rates would impact net interest expense by approximately $20,000. This sensitivity analysis does not take into account the possibility that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category. Fixed rate debt outstanding at December 31, 1999 with a carrying value of $23.8 million has been excluded from the above interest expense sensitivity analysis. The carrying value of the fixed rate debt is comparable to the fair value. Assuming December 31, 1999 fixed rate debt levels, a one point change in interest rates would impact the interest expense by approximately $220,000. Foreign Exchange Operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate movements typically affect economic growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. The sensitivity analysis presented below does not take into account the possibility that rates of the currencies of different countries can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category. The non U.S. dollar operations constitute approximately 26% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 51% of our consolidated operating expenses. As currency exchange rates change, translation of the income statements of our international businesses into U.S. dollars (our reporting currency) affects year over year comparability of operating results. We do not generally enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported results. Changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our non U.S. dollar operating profit include the Belgian franc, German mark and the British pound. We estimate that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates would impact reported operating profit for the year ended December 31, 1999 by approximately $5.0 million. This is after adjusting for unusual impairment and other items. 69 \\n\\n'"
